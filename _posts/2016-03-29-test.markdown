Before I officially begin my story I want to say two things. First I just want to thank you for following my journey over these next few months as I dive into what God has in store for me. It is going to be an amazing adventure. Second I just want to apologize before hand for the grammatical errors that are to come in this blog over the next few months. Even though English is my primary language, it has not been one of my favorite classes, nor is writing one of my strengths.

So Namibia? What many of you may be thinking. Why there? Well let me tell you a little bit of what God has been doing in my life and give you a snippet out of my testimony. One thing that I have continually struggled with since middle-school is a battle with depression. I’ve been through many highs and lows, on this roller coaster of life, but the one thing that has remained constant is God’s unfailing love for me and looking back on my life so far, it is all so very evident.

This past summer I was in a terrible car accident. I fell asleep driving home from work one morning and ended up upside-down in a ditch after a head on collision with a telephone pole. To everyone’s surprise, I was able to climb out of the car with only minor injuries. Only by God’s grace was I spared and I found a new perspective on life. Rather than going through the motions like I had done for so long prior, I was ready to make my relationship with God the number one priority in my life and my what a journey it has been.

Over this past winter break, I went to a missional conference in St. Louis Missouri called Urbana. During this week long conference, with over 16,000 other brothers and sisters in Christ, we began to dive into what God was calling us to do in life. I don’t think I have ever heard God’s voice so clearly in my life. He was calling me to step out in faith and rely on him for my future. There was two areas in my life he was calling me to trust in him for. The first was the men’s small group I had been leading and the second was a missions trip. Not really knowing what either of those meant I accepted the challenge that he placed in my life, knowing fully that he would provide. Little did I know what that would actually require. Shortly after, I stepped down from my job and my internship, my sources of financial security for the semester, and began heading full force into what he had in store for me.

Men’s small group has been such a blessing to me. Building a relationship with other men on campus and seeing them grow as Christians is so rewarding. Currently we have almost to many members to continue calling it a small group! So I’m currently in the process of starting a second one during the week. It is just amazing to see how God is using me now that I am being faithful to him.

Immersion, a one month trip to Namibia in Southern Africa and the focus of this blog. A great opportunity to serve the kingdom without all the distractions in society. I knew God was calling me to go but I was letting the financial aspect of it discourage me because I knew I would never be able to pay for it myself. The trip itself costs $4600, plus I would need additional money for my passport, equipment, and transportation to and from Indiana. So in total I would need around $5500. This number was so daunting. How was I supposed to raise that much if I didn’t even have a job? Then I was reminded of something that my dad always says in ministry. “ If God gives you the vision, he will give you the provision,” and how true is that! How minuscule is $5500 in God’s kingdom. As long as I do what I can do, I am trusting that God will do what I can’t.

So I made placed the down payment, am in the process of the medical portion currently, and am beginning my fundraising! Thank you again for your prayers and financial support.
